IMPORTANT: The "Endless" level series now has its own CryptoCoins and a separate set of heroes. The existing coins have been distributed proportionally. Under certain circumstances, the heroes had to be reset; in this case, the coins have been credited to you and you will have to hire the heroes again.
The difficulty of the Endless levels has been drastically reduced in compensation.

New functions:
- New hero: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

Bug fixes:
- There were no CryptoCoins for level 30.
- ACC chips showed more than one slot, although they can only hold one value.

Miscellaneous:
- Tramiel is limited to level 5 now.
- Upgrade of MEM chips is significantly more expensive and requires Leibniz.
