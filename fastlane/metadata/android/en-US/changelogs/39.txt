New features:
- Starting with "endless" stage 16, heroes may go on holiday. The player must choose one of several proposed heroes and grant leave to one of them.

Bug fixes:
- Attackers that were slowed down by resistors behaved weird in ACC and MEM chips.

Miscellaneous:
- The slowing effect of resistors now depend on the attacker's value. The stronger the attacker, the more it gets slowed.
