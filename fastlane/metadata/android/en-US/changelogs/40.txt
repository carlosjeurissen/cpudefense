New features:
- New heroes: Claude Shannon, George Boole, Whit Diffie
- Resistors now produce heat, which can be converted into information if Shannon is available.
- Some more "Did you know" messages.

Bug fixes:
- Avoid a situation where the player must choose a hero, but none is displayed.
- Heroes always went off for three levels, regardless of what the text said.
- The game uses a default system font if the desired font is not available. This had led to crashes on some devices.
