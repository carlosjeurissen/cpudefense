# Chip Defense

*Chip defense* is a casual game for Android devices of the "tower defense" family. It centres around a design of electric circuits and logical chips that
remind of the good ol' days of 8 bit microprocessors.

The attackers in this game are represented by bits and bytes. To defend the cpu against them, the player builds chips in designated slots. 
These "towers" deal damage by operations such as subtraction, right shift, bitwise and, etc. As usual in these games, the chips can be upgraded in strength.

Additional global upgrades make the game considerably easier. These come as "heroes of the information age": persons that had great influence
on the development of modern computers. For each person there is a short biography.

Currently, the game features some 20 levels, 4 types of chips, and 10 heroes and heroines.
